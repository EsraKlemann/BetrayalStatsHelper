# Betrayal Stats Helper Architecture

## Stack

In this app Svelte has been used to create a frontend, while Java has been used as language in the backend. Gradle as buildtool and Jetty as java webserver.
A mySQL database is used to retreive character info/stats and to save or load adapted characters. The database will initially not be available locally.
